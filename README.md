## What does it do? 🤔

Imagine you want to start a blog, launch a new app, or host a multiplayer game server. Usually, you'd need to learn complicated cloud systems and networking rules. With TopNet, it's as easy as chatting:

1. **You describe what you want:** "I need a WordPress blog with a database," or "Set up a Minecraft server."
2. **TopNet draws it for you:** It instantly generates a clean visual map of your required servers and databases.
3. **It double-checks everything:** TopNet automatically ensures your setup is secure and shows you estimated monthly costs.
4. **Deploy with one click:** Once you're happy with the diagram, TopNet magically sets it all up for you in the real world (using AWS)!
